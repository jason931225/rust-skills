# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning for the rule set.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines (v2026.6) coverage for issue #3.
  First commit added 14 rules plus an `ffi-` category. Follow-up adds 16
  more (`api-impl-rangebounds`, `async-assert-send`, `api-service-clone`,
  `proj-avoid-statics`, `err-catch-unwind-boundary`, `unsafe-means-ub`,
  `ffi-native-escape-hatch`, `ffi-sys-crate-builds`, `proj-works-out-of-box`,
  `test-util-feature`, `doc-first-sentence`, `doc-inline-reexport`,
  `async-future-size`, `perf-global-allocator`, `api-std-types-boundary`,
  `obs-named-events`) and revises `proj-prelude-module` /
  `proj-pub-use-reexport` so they no longer contradict the Microsoft book.
- Independent clause-level audit of all 89 nested guideline pages adds 19
  consolidated rules for missing performance, AI, macro, FFI, unsafe, project,
  API, error, testing, lint, and documentation contracts. Existing rules were
  revised where topic-level mappings had omitted caveats or taught the inverse.
- Executable coverage includes a pinned 89-item source/disposition manifest,
  source-backed validation of every mapped rule and nested reference, focused
  Rust behavior tests where runtime behavior exists, and the existing
  extracted-example compile gate for API-shape guidance.

Now 314 rules across 27 categories.

## [1.5.1]

### Changed
- Depth pass: expanded `own-rc-single-thread` (breaking cycles with `Weak`, the
  `Rc::clone` idiom, `strong_count`/`weak_count`, `!Send`/`!Sync`) and
  `own-refcell-interior` (`Cell` for `Copy` types).
- Added cross-references from ~18 foundational rules to the newer categories
  (`conc-`, `conv-`, `num-`, `serde-`, `trait-`, `closure-`, `coll-`, `pat-`)
  for better navigation between related rules.

## [1.5.0]

### Added
- **Const & Compile-Time** category (`const-`, 4 rules): `const fn`, `const` vs
  `static`, const generics, inline `const { }` blocks.
- **Trait & Generics Design** category (`trait-`, 6 rules): static vs dynamic
  dispatch, associated types vs generic params, default methods, blanket impls,
  object safety, the orphan rule + newtype.
- **Collections** category (`coll-`, 4 rules): map choice (HashMap/BTreeMap/
  IndexMap), sequence choice (Vec/VecDeque), set membership, `BinaryHeap`.
- `checks/gen_index.py` — generates `SKILL.md`'s priority table and Quick
  Reference (and the rule counts) from `rules/` so the index can't drift; CI
  runs it in `--check` mode.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

Now 265 rules across 26 categories.

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **Closures** category (`closure-`, 5 rules): Fn/FnMut/FnOnce bounds, returning
  `impl Fn`, `move` capture, static vs dynamic dispatch, disjoint capture.

Now 251 rules across 23 categories.

## [1.3.0]

### Added
- **Serde** category (`serde-`, 8 rules): rename_all, default, skip, flatten,
  enum representation, deny_unknown_fields, custom (de)serialize, validate-on-
  deserialize.
- **Numeric & Arithmetic Safety** category (`num-`, 5 rules): explicit overflow
  handling, `as` vs `TryFrom`, float comparison, clamping, `NonZero`.

Now 246 rules across 22 categories.

## [1.2.0]

### Added
- **Macros** category (`macro-`, 8 rules): declarative-macro hygiene and
  fragment specifiers, and procedural-macro design with `syn`/`quote`.
- **Observability** category (`obs-`, 7 rules): `tracing`, spans, structured
  fields, error chains, and keeping secrets out of logs.

Now 233 rules across 20 categories.

## [1.1.x]

### Added
- **Unsafe Code** (`unsafe-`), **Concurrency** (`conc-`), **Conversions**
  (`conv-`), and **Pattern Matching** (`pat-`) categories, plus new rules across
  existing categories — 39 rules in total.
- A compile-check harness (`checks/`) and a GitHub Actions CI workflow that
  validates rule structure, links, the index, and that examples compile.

### Changed
- Updated throughout for the Rust 2024 edition and current stable (Rust 1.96):
  fixed `&mut T` is not `Copy`, `impl Trait` in traits, `collect_into` status,
  `resolver = "3"`, `env::set_var` now `unsafe`, and more.

Now 218 rules across 18 categories.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release: 179 rules across 14 categories.
